JUST GRID IT.
=============

Nothing but the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS grid.

Why?
----
Sometimes all you want is a CSS grid. There are plenty of choices out there, but when I started to use them/modify them, they always ended up feeling like the CSS grid system already in Bootstrap.

So instead of learning a new way of doing things I just started to use the ripped out Bootstrap CSS grid.

I figured someone else might want to do the same so I saved you all the whole 5 seconds of doing it yourself.

Manual Usage
------------

JUST GRID IT. splits the Boostrap CSS grid into 5 parts:

[just-grid-it-all.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-all.css) / [just-grid-it-all.min.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-all.min.css)
The grid base and all of the responsive column sizes in one file.

[just-grid-it-base.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-base.css) / [just-grid-it-base.min.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-base.min.css)
The base of the grid with no columns.

[just-grid-it-xs.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-xs.css) / [just-grid-it-xs.min.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-xs.min.css)
The col-xs-N columns.

[just-grid-it-sm.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-sm.css) / [just-grid-it-sm.min.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-sm.min.css)
The col-sm-N responsive columns.

[just-grid-it-md.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-md.css) / [just-grid-it-md.min.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-md.min.css)
The col-md-N responsive columns.

[just-grid-it-lg.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-lg.css) / [just-grid-it-lg.min.css](https://github.com/dyson/just-grid-it/blob/master/css/just-grid-it-lg.min.css)
The col-lg-N responsive columns.

You can either use the full CSS or you can use the base with any combination of column CSS files.
